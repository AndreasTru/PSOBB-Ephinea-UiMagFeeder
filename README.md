# PSOBB-Ephinea-UiMagFeeder

This is a Graphical Mag Feeder for PSOBB. This works on the Ephinea Server, and may work on others (depending on the Item Shop)
 
## Features

The Feeder is based on Autohotkey V2 Beta and implements a simple UI. The Feeder offers the functionality to feed up to 15 Mags at the same time (the KeyDelay for PSOBB is the limiting factor) with a selectable choice of feeding materials.

The UI Displays the needed Meseta and the needed time.

## Usage Guide

Usage is pretty straight forward:

 1. Open the Feeder
 2. Select amount of Mags, Food and Feeding Cycles (1 Feeding Cycle equals 3 Food Mats)
 3. Select the "Shutdown PC after feeding" checkbox if you want your computer to shutdown automatically after feeding is done
 4. Select the "Wait for first feeding Cycle" checkbox if the first cycle should start after approx. 3 Minutes and 30 seconds (to make sure the Mags are hungry)
 5. Buy at least 3 pieces of the Food at the Item Shop
 6. Empty your inventory, so that only Mags and the needed food is present
 7. Place yourself in front of the Item Shop
 8. Hit CTRL+J to start feeding and CTRL+E to exit the Feeder
